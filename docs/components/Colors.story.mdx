# Colors

This list of color should represent all possible color in the application.
Variants of these color can be used to derive a specific shade by using SASS functions like `darken($primary, 10%)` or `lighten($secondary, 15%)`.
Always think about interconnections, please.
If a color is changed here, all derivations across the application are affected.

Naming is an essential part of every color.
Color identifier should be versatile enough, so it can be used for the whole lifetime of the app.
Do not name the color by their usage.
Name them by their mood, meaning or so.
Usage of color can change but name should be persistent.
Also, same color can be used across components and pages so the naming has to be still relevant and understandable.

## Brand

This set of color define a unique visual style that is later used across components to represent the application brand.

<Canvas>
	<Story
		name="Brand"
		args={{
			type: 'brand',
		}}>
		{Template.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## System

This set of color is used to specify system states.
For example a delete button would use the `danger` mood.

<Canvas>
	<Story
		name="System"
		args={{
			type: 'system',
		}}>
		{Template.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>
