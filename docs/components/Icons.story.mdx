# Icons
Icons are essential visual elements in the application design language.
Clear naming helps to reuse the icons as efficiently as possible.
Make sure to name each icon by its visual appearance.
Naming an icon by its usage is usually very limiting and often results in worse reusability.

Icons can be colored in different parts of the application.
Each icon is represented by an icon font as a "letter".
Therefore, coloring a single "letter" with two and more different colors is not possible.

## Animations
Icons can also be animated by several parameters.
Boolean parameters `spin` and `pulse` can help the icon to create a standard loading animation.

<Canvas>
	<Icon name="spinner" spin="true" size="3x"/>
	<Icon name="spinner" pulse="true" size="3x"/>
</Canvas>

## Sizes
String parameter `size` allows to modify the size of the icon.

<Canvas>
	<Icon name="times"/>
	<Icon name="times" size="lg"/>
	<Icon name="times" size="2x"/>
	<Icon name="times" size="3x"/>
	<Icon name="times" size="4x"/>
	<Icon name="times" size="5x"/>
</Canvas>
